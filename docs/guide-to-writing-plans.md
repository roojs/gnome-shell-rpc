# Guide to writing plans

Written for **AI agents** — **mandatory** when an agent drafts, reviews, or implements from **`docs/plans/*`**. Human contributors may treat this as a helpful guide.

Plan files in this repo are `docs/plans/N.N-slug.md`. Completed work is `docs/plans/done/`.

The guide from **Checklist for plans** through **LLM implementer guardrails** is the OLLMchat document, copied here in full (`/home/alan/gitlive/OLLMchat/docs/guide-to-writing-plans.md`). Do not shorten it. Its `{PREFIX}-{number}-{slug}.md` filenames are for plans written in that tree. The worked example `docs/plans/done/7.14.1.3-DONE-details-vala.md` is in that tree too.

> **ℹ️** “Do not stop for status theatre” is an agent rule
> (`.cursor/rules/no-status-theatre.mdc`). It does **not** go in plans.
> User call 2026-10-02: that text is not for general reading, and it does
> not belong in every plan. Do **not** paste it into plans, bugs, or other docs.

## Agent rule: product goal follows the active plan

**🔷 CRITICAL.** There is no active plan. **1.2** and subplans **1.2.1–1.2.5** are **✅** (user 2026-10-05) in [`plans/done/`](plans/done/). Parent: [`done/1.2-teardown-and-restart.md`](plans/done/1.2-teardown-and-restart.md).

- **1.1** is **✅** (user 2026-10-03) — [`done/1.1-installable-bootable-session.md`](plans/done/1.1-installable-bootable-session.md).
- **0.8** is **✅** (user 2026-10-02) — [`done/0.8-init-complete-and-interaction.md`](plans/done/0.8-init-complete-and-interaction.md). **0.8.4** and **0.8.6** are **✅** in [`plans/done/`](plans/done/). **0.8.3** is **✔️** (H1 only, 2026-10-05) in [`plans/done/0.8.3-rpc-lid-hardening.md`](plans/done/0.8.3-rpc-lid-hardening.md).
- **0.9** and **1.0** stay backlog and are not active.
- **1.3** is **✅** archived 2026-10-06 — [`plans/done/1.3-boxed-type-generator.md`](plans/done/1.3-boxed-type-generator.md).
- Boot-through-`init.js` is **✔️** archived under [`done/0.7.7-thin-shell-bootstrap.md`](plans/done/0.7.7-thin-shell-bootstrap.md). Plans **0.1–0.7** live in [`plans/done/`](plans/done/) — reference only.
- Treat stub completeness, header %, and full API parity as **means** — only pursue them when they unblock the **current** plan phase.
- Put the **user goal** from the active plan at the **top of every new plan** (after the title). Do not bury it. With no active plan, do not start **0.9** or **1.0** until the user names the next one.
- Prefer fix-forward on the nested path over speculative completeness. Agents still do not `meson install` onto the live prefix or log in without an ask in that message.

It is the **canonical** place for: plan shape, code-proposal fences, **ordered chunk format** for large methods, **implementation workflow**, and the **checklist for plans**. Coding and build standards live in **`docs/coding-standards.md`** and **`docs/build-rules.md`**. When **implementing** Vala from a plan, use **`docs/coding-standards-router.md`** to choose which coding-standards sections to read (do not read the whole file by default).

## Checklist for plans

Copy or reference this section at the top of new plan documents in **`docs/plans/`**. Use it before marking a plan ready to implement.

### Plan structure and code proposals

- **Single location per topic** — concrete **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** fences live in the **same section** that discusses that work (e.g. **Phase 2** proposals under **Phase 2**, not repeated later). See **Code proposals — one place, not two**.
- **Single canonical code proposal** — no duplicate stitched-together versions (e.g. Part 1…N **and** a separate full-method block that could drift). See **Code proposals section** — *Don't publish duplicate stitched-together versions*.
- **Edit syntax** — actionable fences as **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** only; **Keep** is unchanged context, never an edit instruction. See **Edit syntax contract**.
- **No orphan code** — do **not** paste implementation fences in **Purpose**, **LLM notes**, or a second **Concrete code proposals** chapter that repeats topic sections. See **Code proposals — one place, not two**.
- **New methods in plans** — do not add helpers unless the user or plan explicitly asks. See bullets under **Discussion style** below and **Method names and new methods** in **`docs/coding-standards.md`**.

## Plan implementation workflow

Applies when implementing **feature or refactor work** from **`docs/plans/*`**, tickets, or explicit user instructions.

1. **Implement only what was approved** (the written plan or agreed scope). Do not expand scope silently.

2. **If something blocks you** (build errors, missing fields, wrong API split, design hole):
   - **Revert** speculative or partial code rather than piling on workarounds.
   - **Update the plan** (or the relevant doc): what failed, what must change, options if any.
   - **Stop and ask for explicit user approval** before continuing implementation.

3. **No surprise fixes**: do not add drive-by refactors, unrelated cleanups, or “compile-only” API changes unless the user approved that change in the plan or in chat.

4. **Plan status honesty**: after implementing, mark work **✔️** (agent done) — **not** **✅**. Only the user promotes items to **✅**. Do not delete backlog bullets or shrink **Suggested order** until the user confirms.

5. **Exception**: trivial edits the user asked for in the same message (typos, formatting) are fine—still avoid unrelated code changes.

**Bug fixes** follow **`docs/bug-fix-process.md`** (debug → understand → propose → approval → apply). This workflow adds the **revert + plan update + approval** loop when **planned implementation** hits design gaps.

## Audience

- **Humans** skim **title**, **status**, **`## Purpose`**, then the **phase or topic section** they are implementing (proposals are **in that section**). Long narrative sections are **rarely read** — do not rely on them for requirements.
- **Implementers** need **verbatim hunks** (**Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** / **Keep**) and file paths **next to** the discussion of that change.
- **Long prose** is at best **AI/session context**; it is not a substitute for **code blocks** and emoji-prefixed bullets.

## Tone and length

- **Requests + very brief summaries only** (purpose in a short paragraph or bullets).
- Avoid essays, “current behaviour” novels, and duplicated explanations — put the contract in **code blocks** and nested bullets.
- **Strongly prefer nested bullet points** over long prose. If a sentence would run past **one line** in a typical editor width, split it into sub-bullets or tighten the wording — dense paragraphs are hard to skim and easy to miss in review.
- **Do not chain several key points in one paragraph** using **semicolons (`;`)** or **long dashes** (em dash, en dash, or hyphen used as a “second clause” separator). That pattern usually means the content should be **nested bullets** (one idea per bullet, optional sub-bullets under a parent).
- **Prefer short sentences over paragraphs** for narrative bits: one sentence per bullet when possible, not a block of three sentences glued together.

## Discussion style (emoji prefixes)

For **discussion, rationale, risks, and notes** (anything that is not a mechanical **Keep** / **Remove** / **Replace** section), **prefix each paragraph or bullet group with one emoji** from the legend below so readers can scan intent quickly. The **first token** on the line should be the emoji (then a space, then the text).

- **Do not** wrap emoji prefixes or code identifiers in bold — use plain `🔷` / `💩` / `⏳` and single backticks for paths and identifiers (e.g. `BackgroundScan`, not `**BackgroundScan**`).

**Status and workstream (use liberally for backlog honesty):**

| Marker | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **✅** | **User confirmed done** — only after the user approves or verifies on device (green check) |
| **✔️** | **Agent implemented** — code landed or agent claims it works; **not** user-approved yet (grey check) |
| **⏳** | Not implemented or not matching spec — backlog (use this liberally) |
| **🌗** | Partially done — polish or follow-up still owed (legacy; prefer **✔️** + **⏳** for agent vs backlog) |

**Provenance (who said what):**

| Marker | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **🔷** | **User-specified requirement** — treat as authoritative (use this for anything the user stated as a requirement in chat or in the plan) |
| **💩** | Suggestion **introduced by the LLM** that the **user did not ask for** — optional, confirm before building it in |
| **ℹ️** | Reference or pointer — external doc, spec, ticket, prior plan, or file path worth opening (not a status claim) |
| **🚫** | Rejected for this plan or **do not implement** — out of scope, anti-pattern, or user veto (list these so implementers do not “helpfully” add them) |

**Legacy:** older plans may still use **⚠️** for the same meaning as **🔷** (user-authored requirement). Prefer **🔷** in new and updated plans. Older plans may still use **👎** for the same meaning as **🚫** (rejected / out of scope). Prefer **🚫** in new and updated plans. Older plans may still use **🔶** for the same meaning as **🌗** (partially done). Prefer **🌗** in new and updated plans.

**✅** vs **✔️** (mandatory — do not confuse them):

- **✔️** — agent implemented or agent believes it is fixed; user has **not** confirmed yet.
- **✅** — user explicitly confirmed done (device test, manual verify, or “that’s done” in chat). **Do not** promote **✔️ → ✅** yourself.
- **Do not** mark backlog items **✅**, remove them from **Backlog**, or rewrite **Suggested order** to skip work the user has not signed off. **Do not invent completion** — if unsure, leave **⏳**.

**✅** is **not** for “user approved” a *requirement* — use **🔷** for user-specified requirements. **✅** is only for *completed work* the user verified.

**Combining provenance + backlog:**

- **⏳** means **not done yet** (todo / backlog). It is a **status**, not provenance.
- **🚫 Do not** prefix a todo bullet with **⏳** alone — readers cannot tell whether you or the user asked for the work.
- **Do** pair **⏳** with **🔷** or **💩** on every open work item:
  - One line: **`🔷` `⏳`** … (you asked; not done) or **`💩` `⏳`** … (LLM inferred; not done)
  - Or parent **`🔷`** / **`💩`** with a child bullet **`⏳`** … for the same item
- **ℹ️** / **🚫** bullets are pointers or vetoes — no **⏳** unless there is also an explicit follow-up task; then use **`🔷` `⏳`** or **`💩` `⏳`**.
- Plan **`Status:`** line may use **⏳** alone for overall plan state (meta, not a task bullet).

### 💩 Mark LLM-only content (mandatory in plans)

When drafting or updating a plan from user chat, **separate what they said from what you invented**:

- **🔷** — user stated it, or clearly approved it in the thread (requirements, constraints, names they chose).
- **💩** — **anything you add that the user did not mention** — extra fields, heuristics, save behaviour, CLI guards, helpers, scope expansion, acceptance bullets, “still visible” lists, etc.
- **🚫** — user said **no** or it is explicitly rejected in review (so implementers do not reintroduce it).

**Rules:**

- Do **not** bury **💩** ideas inside **🔷** bullets — give each its **own** **💩** line or table row so review is one glance.
- Before finishing a plan, scan: every requirement is **🔷**, **💩**, **ℹ️**, or **🚫** — nothing unmarked that reads like a mandate.
- **💩** does not mean “wrong” — it means **confirm before build**. User can promote **💩 → 🔷** in review.

**Example:**

- **🔷** Detection uses **`GET /api/version`** via **`Call.Version`**.
- **🚫** URL shape / **`…/api/`** heuristics for detection — not part of this feature.
- **💩** Also hide **`top_k`** in options UI (not mentioned in chat; optional).

---

- **Do not add new methods** unless the plan or the user **explicitly** asks for them (see **`docs/coding-standards.md`** — [Method names and new methods](coding-standards.md#method-names-and-new-methods)).
- **Private helpers are not automatically an improvement** — they are often **bloat**, hide the real flow, and scatter logic. Default to **changing existing methods** and **inlining** at the call site.
- **Readability via extraction is the user’s decision**, not the implementer’s default. Do not introduce helpers “for clarity” unless the user wants that refactor.

## Required shape (match `docs/plans/done/6.6-DONE-*.md` and `docs/plans/done/6.8-DONE-fixing-large-restore.md`)

1. **Title** — `# N.N Title`
2. **`Status:`** — proposed | done | rejected
3. **Pointer** — **`docs/guide-to-writing-plans.md`** **Checklist for plans** (copy bullets or link to that section); proposed Vala code must follow **`docs/coding-standards.md`**
4. **`## Purpose`** — nested bullets for **human planning review**: **🔷** what we are doing, **⏳** backlog, **ℹ️** pointers only — **not** a dump of **🚫** vetoes (see **LLM implementer guardrails** at end of this guide)
5. **Topic sections** — design, schema, tasks, audit lists, **and inline code proposals** for that topic (emoji-prefixed bullets; **no** boilerplate sections below)

Optional, keep short:

- **`## Current behaviour`** — bullets only
- **`## Proposed behaviour`** — bullets only

**🚫 Do not** add a trailing **`## Concrete code proposals`** (or **`## Proposed code changes`**) that **repeats** numbered **`###`** hunks already given under a phase or topic section. If everything is deferred, one short **⏳** line per topic is enough — no empty proposals chapter.

## Sections to avoid in plans

**🚫 Do not add these** — they duplicate **Purpose** and are rarely maintained:

- **`## Scope`** / “In scope | Out of scope” — duplicates **Purpose**; omit
- **🚫** bullets in **`## Purpose`** or topic sections — vetoes belong in **LLM implementer guardrails** (this guide), parent plan phase boundaries, or optional **`## LLM notes`** at plan bottom — not mixed into what the human is reviewing
- **`## Acceptance criteria`** — use **⏳** bullets in **Purpose** or **Phase N tasks** instead
- **Markdown tables** in plan bodies — **strongly avoid**; they are hard to read in review. Use **nested bullets** instead (emoji legend tables in *this guide* are fine)

**🚫** Do not abbreviate names for speech-to-text (e.g. `bg_scan`) — use the real identifier (e.g. **`BackgroundScan`**, not bare **`Scan`**).

## Code proposals section (mandatory pattern)

Intro line for any fenced hunk: edits are **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** from the tree;
verify surrounding context before applying.

### Code proposals — one place, not two

**🔷** Each implementable change is documented **once**, in the section where that work is discussed (e.g. **`## Phase 2`** contains both the audit bullets **and** the **`###` + fences** for Phase 2 edits).

**🚫 Do not:**

- Summarize Phase 2 in a topic section, then paste the **same** **`### 3. Connection.vala`** hunks again under **`## Concrete code proposals`** at the bottom.
- Make the reader jump between “what to do” (top) and “how to do it” (bottom) for the **same** phase.

**Do:**

- Use **`## Phase N`** (or **`## Topic`**) as the **only** home for that phase’s narrative **and** its **`###` file headings** + **`#### Remove`** / **`#### Replace with`** / **`#### Add`** fences.
- For **done** work, a one-line **✔️** pointer to the tree (e.g. “see **`libocrpc/Bin/Stream.vala`**”) — **no** duplicate fence archive.

A standalone **`## Concrete code proposals`** heading is **legacy**. New and updated plans should **not** use it unless the **entire** plan is a single short proposals list with **no** phase sections (rare).

### Edit syntax contract (strict)

- **Action syntax is only:** **`Remove`**, **`Replace with`**, and **`Add`**.
- **`Keep` means unchanged context only**. It is never an edit operation.
- If a plan can be applied without `Keep` fences, prefer that simpler form.
- When needed, describe unchanged context in **Where** text rather than adding a
  `Keep` code block.

### Do / don’t (remove / replace / add)

- **Don’t publish duplicate stitched-together versions** of the same unit of work. A plan must **not** leave implementers choosing between (a) a long chain of **Keep** / **Remove** / **Replace** parts and (b) a second, parallel “full method” or “full file” paste that could **drift** from the parts—nor require **mental assembly** of unstated lines between fences. Pick **one** canonical form:
  - **Small change:** parts + anchors are fine if every **removed** line appears in a **Remove** fence and every **new** line appears in **Replace with** / **Add**, with **Keep** only as **local** anchors (already in this guide); or
  - **Large replacement:** one **Remove** of the old region (method, ctor, or whole file) and one **Replace with** containing the **complete** new text—no separate “Part 1 … Part 7” that duplicates the same outcome.
- **Do** put the contract in **fenced code blocks** under **Remove** /
  **Replace with** / **Add**. The implementer applies **verbatim hunks**, not a
  paraphrase.
- **Don’t** replace code blocks with long prose about what to keep or replace (“delete the old loop and insert …”) **without** the matching fences.
- **Do** use **`#### Add`** (or an **Add** chunk in the ordered format) for **pure insertions** — new lines only, nothing deleted.
- **Don’t** use **`Remove`** with `// (nothing)` or “nothing to remove” to mean
  insertion. If there is nothing to delete, there is **no Remove** — use
  **Add**.
- **Don’t** publish a **`#### Add`** (or ordered-chunk **Add**) that is
  **only** a code fence. The implementer must get **mechanical context**
  without guessing: every **Add** must state **where** the new lines go (file,
  method or region, and position relative to a named line) and **what** they do
  (one short sentence). Put that in the **`#### Add — …`** heading suffix
  and/or **immediately below** **`#### Add`** as a line or bullets **before**
  the fence. A pointer (**see § X**) is allowed **only if** the referenced
  section contains the **same** verbatim fence and the same placement
  sentence—otherwise the **Add** block is incomplete.
- **Do** keep that **placement + purpose** line on **Replace with** / **Add** (ordered chunks use it on the line immediately above the fence—see below); keep it short — the **fence** carries the literals.

### No orphan or illustrative code

Plans are **edit specs**, not codebase tours. If a reader cannot apply a fence mechanically, the plan is wrong.

- **Don’t** put **fenced implementation code** in **Purpose**, **Precedent**, **Notes**, **Related**, or **LLM notes** — put fences under the **phase/topic `###`** they belong to.
- **Don’t** duplicate the same fence in **two** sections (topic + trailing proposals chapter). See **Code proposals — one place, not two**.
- **Don’t** paste “pattern” or “precedent” excerpts from other files (e.g. two
  lines from `libocrpc/Response.vala`) unless that excerpt is itself the
  **exact** hunk to apply, labelled **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add**.
- **Don’t** use investigation-style citations (`startLine:endLine:path` blocks, random mid-file snippets) in implementation plans. **ℹ️** Point at `path/to/file.vala` and commit hash; the implementer opens the file.
- **Don’t** split one logical edit across multiple `###` sections if that
  forces the reader to merge hunks mentally (e.g. “Part A adds `else`” + “Part
  B replaces `if` body”). Use **one** **Remove** + **Replace with** for the
  whole region, or **ordered chunks** inside a **single** `###`.
- **Do** label every `###` with: **file path**, **function/method/region name**, and **one-line intent** (e.g. `### 1. \`ollmfilesd/File.vala\` — \`read()\`: RPC relay + history merge`).
- **Do** make every edit locatable: include the **enclosing** method /
  `foreach` / `if` line in the `###` title and state exact position in
  **Where** text.
- **Investigation / query docs** (`*-query.md`, `docs/bugs/*`) may quote existing code to explain behaviour. **Implementation plans** (`docs/plans/*.md` except query docs) must not — link to the investigation instead.
- **Don’t** use the **next** method below your edit as a locator (e.g. putting `public void enqueue` inside **Remove**/**Replace with** when only one `return` changes). The next method is not being edited — it confuses *where* vs *what*.
- **Don’t** use disconnected context snippets for one small change. Use one
  tight **Remove** + **Replace with** pair and a precise **Where** line.
- **Do** under each `###`, before the fences, state **Why** (dependency / outcome), **Where** (function + position in plain English), and **Depends on** (other `###` in this plan, if any). The hunks alone are not enough.
- **Don’t** use `…`, `// ...`, or “rest unchanged” inside **Keep** / **Remove** / **Replace with** fences. Every line in a fence must be **verbatim** from the tree (or the exact new lines to apply). If the anchor is long, include the real lines — do not abbreviate.

**Bad (do not write plans like this):**

~~~markdown
### 2. `ollmfilesd/Vector/BackgroundScan.vala` — `scanProject()` early exit

#### Keep
```vala
	public void scanProject (OLLMfilesd.Folder? project)
	{
```

#### Keep
```vala
		GLib.debug ("scanning …");
```

#### Remove
```vala
		return;
	}

	public void enqueue (string path)
```
~~~

Problems: signature **Keep** is far from the edit; `…` is not real code; **Remove** includes the **next** method; no **Why** / **Where** / **Depends on**.

**Good (real one-line change — same file, same edit):**

~~~markdown
### 2. `libocrpc/Response.vala` — `result`: always a list

**Why:** §1.5 handlers append to `result`; nullable `GLib.Object?` forces null checks and separate `is_array` wire flags.

**Where:** class body — `result` property declaration.

**Depends on:** none.

#### Remove
```vala
		public GLib.Object? result { get; set; default = null; }
```

#### Replace with
```vala
		public Gee.ArrayList<GLib.Object> result {
			get;
			set;
			default = new Gee.ArrayList<GLib.Object> ();
		}
```
~~~

Reader can open `Response.vala`, find the `result` property, and apply without guessing.

For **each** file/topic, use a **numbered** `###` heading, then **only** these subheadings above code:

| Subheading | Use |
| ---------- | --- |
| **`#### Remove`** | Verbatim code to delete |
| **`#### Replace with`** | Full replacement of the **Remove** block (or the named fragment) — not necessarily the whole file |
| **`#### Add`** | New code only (no removal). Must include **where** + **what** (heading suffix or line above fence)—see **Don’t** “only a code fence” in **Do / don’t**. |

**Example** (outer fence is `~~~` so inner fences parse):

~~~markdown
### 1. `lib/foo/Bar.vala` — frob the widget

#### Remove

```vala
		old_call();
```

#### Replace with

```vala
		new_call();
```
~~~

One **`####` heading immediately above each fenced block.** No code fence without a **`####`** label.

### Editing existing methods (strong preference)

When changing a **method that already exists**, **split it into parts** — one
logical edit per subsection (e.g. **`##### Part 1 — Signature`**,
**`##### Part 2 — …`**). For **each** part:

- **`#### Remove`** / **`#### Replace with`** / **`#### Add`** — The **small**
  verbatim fragments for **that part only**.

Apply parts **in order** (Part 1, then 2, …). Each part must be mechanically
applicable from **Remove/Replace with/Add** plus the section's **Where** text.

- **Whole-method / whole-file `Replace with`:** Only for **new** methods or
  **new** files. For **existing** methods, use **ordered chunks** (below) —
  not one **Remove** of the whole method plus a full paste.
- **Why use parts at all?** Small, localized diffs preserve a clear review story—but only when each part is **mechanically complete** and **not** mirrored by a second full copy elsewhere in the plan.
- **Empty default bodies** (e.g. a virtual hook): short **Goal** text; **Remove**/**Replace with** for the old vs new **fragment** (e.g. signature + comment), not a lone **Replace with** with no **Remove**.
- **When every line of the method changes** or the method is **new:** a single
  full-method **`Replace with`** (with **`Remove`** of the old method) is OK
  for **new** methods only. For an **existing** method, use **ordered chunks**
  (**Keep** / **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add**) even when most lines
  change — reviewers must see what stays vs what changes. **Do not** write
  "Remove entire method" with a full **Replace with** paste and no **Keep**
  anchors.

**Very short** methods (a few lines) may use one small **Remove** /
**Replace with** pair without splitting into parts.

### Ordered chunk format for large methods

Use this when a **single** fenced block would be ambiguous—typically **large or heavily edited methods**, or any region where the reader must apply edits **in sequence** through the body.

**Small, one-off edits** can stay a **single** fenced `vala` block with enough surrounding context.

#### Cycle (repeat top → bottom until the method or region is done)

Interleave in this order:

1. **Keep** — Fenced block of **unchanged** code (enough lines to anchor the next edit—usually starts or ends a stable span).
2. Then either:
   - **Remove** + **Replace with** — **Remove** is only for **verbatim lines to delete**. **Replace with** — *one-line reason*, then a fence of **new** code that replaces what was removed; or
   - **Add** — *reason* naming **where** + **what** (placement relative to the prior **Keep** and purpose—may be one line or two short lines), then a fence of **new** code only — use this for **pure insertions** (do **not** pair with an empty **Remove**). A fence **without** that reason is incomplete (**Do / don’t**).

Then **Keep** again and repeat as needed.

The **reason** sits on the **Replace with** or **Add** line **immediately above** that block’s code fence. Example: **Replace with** — Set status to REFINEMENT while refinement runs.

#### Rules

- Each **Keep**, **Remove**, **Replace with**, and **Add** that carries code gets its **own** fenced block.
- Do **not** merge several logical edits into one **Replace with** / **Add** unless they are inseparable.
- **Keep** blocks must match the **current** source so a reader can verify line-for-line before editing.

You may label each block with plain **Keep** / **Remove** / **Replace with** / **Add** (as in many plans) or with the same headings as elsewhere in this guide (**`#### Keep`**, etc.)—same meaning.

#### Example (one cycle — insertion after anchor)

**Keep**

```vala
	void foo() {
```

**Add** — Initialize state required for the following logic.

```vala
		this.bar = 1;
```

**Keep**

```vala
	}
```

#### Reference plan (long worked example)

**`docs/plans/done/7.14.1.3-DONE-details-vala.md`** — **Files** section: **`Details.refine`**, **`run_exec`**, **`extract_exec`**, and **`####` … `— ordered chunks`** subsections (uses **Add** for pure insertions per **Do / don’t** above).

### Implementable code belongs in fences

- Anything the implementer must apply must appear as verbatim code under **`#### Remove`**, **`#### Replace with`**, **`#### Add`**, or **`#### Keep`** — **not** only in narrative bullets (“add a case for X”, “move the call after the catch”) without a matching fence.
- Quoted notes, tickets, or user paste-ins: use **`#### Keep (verbatim)`** (or similar) above each fence so the mandatory **`####` + fence** rule still holds.

### Plans and defensive code

Follow **`docs/coding-standards.md`** — [Defensive code and null checks](coding-standards.md#defensive-code-and-null-checks): do not specify speculative guards, redundant validation, or “just in case” API surface (e.g. extra **`deserialize_property`** branches) unless there is a **real boundary** or **external contract**. Prefer the smallest change that matches the actual call paths.

## Done / archive

When implemented: put **`DONE`** or **`REJECTED`** in the slug. While a numbered range is still in flight, keep those files in **`docs/plans/`** so the sequence stays visible. Move the range into **`docs/plans/done/`** when that range is archived. One-line **Status** and a pointer to files changed.

### Filenames

- **`{PREFIX}-{number}-{slug}.md`** — prefix is the library short name (`RPC`, `TOOLS`, `FILES`, …). List: **`docs/plans/-README.md`**.
- New work under a prefix is **`{PREFIX}-1.n-slug.md`**. **`{PREFIX}-1.0-summary.md`** is the category index.
- Old files keep their original numbers (`RPC-8.3.6-…`). Do not mint a new global major (`9.1-…`).
- **[`docs/plans/done/9.0-restructure-plans.md`](plans/done/9.0-restructure-plans.md)** is the last unprefixed numbered plan.

### Sub-plans and `{PREFIX}-1.0-summary.md`

- **Do not** add or edit entries in **`{PREFIX}-1.0-summary.md`** for in-progress sub-plans.
- Put a **prominent blockquote at the top** of each sub-plan stating that the prefix **1.0** is **not** updated until the sub-plan is **done** and archived.
- Update the prefix **1.0** **only** when closing a plan (optional — user may skip even then).
- **`docs/plans/-README.md`** is categories only — not a per-plan checklist.

## LLM implementer guardrails (not for human planning review)

**🚫 Do not** fill **`## Purpose`** (or design sections) with **out-of-scope**, **“do not implement”**, or **“that’s Phase N”** bullets. Humans use the plan to review **what we are building**; a wall of **🚫** is noise and reads like the author stalling itself.

**Where guardrails live instead:**

- **This guide** — workflow, sections to avoid, don’t expand scope.
- **Parent / overview plan** — phase boundaries in **Phase summary** (short), not repeated in every sub-plan.
- **Sub-plans** — **🔷** + **⏳** + **ℹ️** only in **Purpose**; trust the parent for “Phase 2 is elsewhere”.
- **Optional** — if a plan truly needs agent-only reminders, add **`## LLM notes`** as the **last** section. Keep it short. **Do not** duplicate proposals or **🚫** lists from earlier phases.

**When implementing:** follow **Plan implementation workflow** above; if tempted to add a feature outside **🔷** bullets, **stop and ask** — do not “document” every temptation as **🚫** in the plan file.



## Agent rule: do not change the user’s session

**🚫 CRITICAL.** Do not mutate the live desktop without an explicit ask in the current message.

- **🚫** `meson install` / writing under `/usr`
- **🚫** killing host `gnome-shell`, `gjs`, or the user’s Wayland/X11 session
- **🚫** `kill -9` against host processes
- **🚫** replacing `/run/user/*/wayland-0`

**Allowed without asking:** repo edits, meson **build** in this tree, nested `mutter --wayland --devkit --mutter-plugin /abs/path/to/our.so` inside `dbus-run-session`.

When a session or install step is needed: print the command, explain why, wait.
